        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This websites appears to be a simple page that displays a button and a list of items. When you click the button, it reveals the next item in the list, allowing you to progressively discover the contents of the virtual bag.</p>
        <h3>Breakdown</h3>
        <p>Between the script tags, the variable "t" is declared as an array containing strings, each representing a list of items that could be in this bag. Each string is separated into parts using .split(0), which creates an array of 
            phrases related to items like a credit card, cash, shopping bags, etc. The script uses a loop to randomize the order in which items from the "t" array are displayed. The "o" varaible is an array of randomized positions corresponding 
            to each item in "t".
        <br>
            The "l.onclick" function defines what happens when the button is clicked. If the button is clicked, it adds a new phrase from the "t" array to the existing paragraph element. The script tracks the current position in the "h" array and 
            goes through the list of items, adding them one by one to the page. The button also appears to disappear from the page when the list is finished. </p>
